An attack data structure that represents a set of potential
techniques for exploiting security vulnerabilities [MAUW05, MOOR01, SCHN99]. The security
incident that is the goal of the attack is represented as the root node of the tree, and the ways by
which an attacker could reach that goal are iteratively and incrementally represented as branches
and subnodes of the tree. Each subnode defines a subgoal, and each subgoal may have its own
set of further subgoals, and so on. The final nodes on the paths outward from the root, that is, the
leaf nodes, represent different ways to initiate an attack. Each node other than a leaf is either an
AND-node or an OR-node. To achieve the goal represented by an AND-node, the subgoals
represented by all of that nodeâ€™s subnodes must be achieved; and for an OR-node, at least one of
the subgoals must be achieved. Branches can be labeled with values representing difficulty, cost,
or other attack attributes, so that alternative attacks can be compared.
